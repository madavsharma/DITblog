                    Web development is not concerned with the design of a website; rather, it’s all about the coding and
                    programming that powers the website’s functionality.
                    From the most simple, static web pages to social media platforms and apps, from e-commerce websites
                    to content management systems (CMS)—all the tools we use via the internet on a daily basis have been
                    built by developers.</h3><br>

                </ul><br>
                <p>Web development, also known as website development, refers to the tasks associated with creating,
                    building, and maintaining websites and web applications that run online on a browser. It may,
                    however, also include web design, web programming, and database management.

                    Web development is closely related to the job of designing the features and functionality of apps
                    (web design). The term development is usually reserved for the actual construction of these things
                    (that is to say, the programming of sites).

                    The basic tools involved in web development are programming languages called HTML (Hypertext Markup
                    Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript. There are, however, a number of other
                    programs used to “manage” or facilitate the construction of sites that would otherwise have to be
                    done “from scratch” by writing code. A number of content management systems (CMS) fall into this
                    category, including WordPress, Vscode etc.</p> <br>

                    I usually wake up at around 8 am and my first lecture is at 10:45 am. From 10:45 to 12:45, we have
                    two lectures then Lunch braek is provided to us. Then we have again two lectures from 1:30 pm to
                    3:30 pm, rest we have lab hours. During lectures, you always have time to ask questions and each
                    academic will give you a further suggested reading list if you’d like to dive deeper into the topic.

                <p>
                    In addition to the lectures and hands-on labs we also have tutorials. Tutorials give you the option
                    to
                    revise the material covered that week in more depth and often include past paper questions.
                    Tutorials
                    are taught by teaching assistants, and they are your go-to person to consult with as they have done
                    the
                    same course before.

                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>The lab sessions are designed around the same topics covered in the lectures but now you are tasked
                    with building and exercising in practice what you were taught in theory beforehand. The labs are a
                    great way to actually experience many areas of computer engineering. </p>
